     3	Every `SKILL.md` in this plugin is generated from `catalog.json` and starts by pointing here. These rules apply to all skills; a skill file repeats only what is specific to its task.

     6	
     7	Country, jurisdiction, response language, currency and timezone are separate choices. Read [country context](country-context.md) before relying on any of them, and the [Angola reference](countries/angola.md) when Angola applies. If no country is supplied, disclose Angola as a provisional starting context. Respect an explicit langu …

   → 1	# Project manifest (`provia-project/v1.1`)
     2	
     3	One implementation project has one manifest, `provia-project.json`. Every skill reads it before starting and appends its result to it, so entity types, groups, workflow actions, forms and decisions are one graph rather than a folder of unrelated files. The map renderer draws that graph; `setup.md` is generated from what the manifest still leaves unresolved; the connected-mode `apply` steps consume it in dependency order.

     2	
     3	After completing a skill, end the final chat response with one short, optional recommendation that advances the user's current workflow. Include the exact next skill name, why it is useful now, and a copyable invocation containing the relevant artifact or result from this task. Write it in the user's response language. Put it in the final chat response, not only in an attached report or intermediate commentary.

     3	Establish country of operation, applicable jurisdiction, response language, currency, timezone, sector and the organization’s own policy. Do not derive jurisdiction from the language of a document. If no country is supplied, disclose Angola as a provisional starting context. Ask before relying on a jurisdiction for a legal conclusion. An English conversation can still concern Angola; Portuguese can concern another country.

     2	
     3	Provia's API Gateway exposes an MCP server, `provia-implementer`, specified in Provia feature 026 and extended by feature 027 (workflow permissions), pinned to the same product revision as this plugin's contract engine. When an implementer signs in through it, the skills can read the destination organization and create **draft** configuration on the implementer's behalf. This reference is the plugin side of that contract. Until the server is released in the implementer's environment, every skill behaves exactly as in disconnected mode; do not  …

     5	A Workflow defines a repeatable process. An Incident is one execution of a workflow. An Action is one step. Entities hold reusable business records, metadata holds structured case values, tags classify records, and pages/files/comments provide explanation and evidence. Explain “incident” as a process case when the business context is not emergency response.
