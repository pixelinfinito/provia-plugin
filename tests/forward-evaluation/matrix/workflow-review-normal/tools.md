Read [country context](country-context.md) before relying on any of them, and the [Angola reference](countries/angola.md) when Angola applies. If no country is supplied, disclose Angola as a provisional starting context. Respect an explicit langu …

     5	## Name the work
     6	
     7	Write every action name as a concise instruction describing the work expected. In Portuguese, start with an infinitive verb; in English, start with a base-form action verb. Use a verb, an object and only the qualifier needed to identify the task. Aim for 3–10 words and roughly 80 characters when meaning permits. These are editorial guidelines, not Provia contract limits.

     2	
     3	Who may see and open a workflow is design data, declared in the manifest, reviewed with the customer in the Acesso tab of `project.html`, checked by `--check` and applied either through the `access` section of the portable YAML (browser import) or through `workflow_access_apply` (connected mode). Silence is never an accident: a workflow without an `access` section fails `--check`.

     2	
     3	Provia's API Gateway exposes an MCP server, `provia-implementer`, specified in Provia feature 026 and extended by feature 027 (workflow permissions), pinned to the same product revision as this plugin's contract engine. When an implementer signs in through it, the skills can read the destination organization and create **draft** configuration on the implementer's behalf. This reference is the plugin side of that contract. Until the server is released in the implementer's environment, every skill behaves exactly as in disconnected mode; do not  …

   → 1	# Project manifest (`provia-project/v1.1`)
     2	
     3	One implementation project has one manifest, `provia-project.json`. Every skill reads it before starting and appends its result to it, so entity types, groups, workflow actions, forms and decisions are one graph rather than a folder of unrelated files. The map renderer draws that graph; `setup.md` is generated from what the manifest still leaves unresolved; the connected-mode `apply` steps consume it in dependency order.
